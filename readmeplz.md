Get started with Live API




The Live API enables low-latency, real-time voice and video interactions with Gemini. It processes continuous streams of audio, video, or text to deliver immediate, human-like spoken responses, creating a natural conversational experience for your users.

Live API Overview

Live API offers a comprehensive set of features such as Voice Activity Detection, tool use and function calling, session management (for managing long running conversations) and ephemeral tokens (for secure client-sided authentication).

This page gets you up and running with examples and basic code samples.

Choose an implementation approach
When integrating with Live API, you'll need to choose one of the following implementation approaches:

Server-to-server: Your backend connects to the Live API using WebSockets. Typically, your client sends stream data (audio, video, text) to your server, which then forwards it to the Live API.
Client-to-server: Your frontend code connects directly to the Live API using WebSockets to stream data, bypassing your backend.
Note: Client-to-server generally offers better performance for streaming audio and video, since it bypasses the need to send the stream to your backend first. It's also easier to set up since you don't need to implement a proxy that sends data from your client to your server and then your server to the API. However, for production environments, in order to mitigate security risks, we recommend using ephemeral tokens instead of standard API keys.
Partner integrations
To streamline the development of real-time audio and video apps, you can use a third-party integration that supports the Gemini Live API over WebRTC or WebSockets.

Microphone stream Audio file stream

This server-side example streams audio from the microphone and plays the returned audio. For complete end-to-end examples including a client application, see Example applications.

The input audio format should be in 16-bit PCM, 16kHz, mono format, and the received audio uses a sample rate of 24kHz.

Python
JavaScript
Install helpers for audio streaming. Additional system-level dependencies (e.g. portaudio) might be required. Refer to the PyAudio docs for detailed installation steps.


pip install pyaudio
Note: Use headphones. This script uses the system default audio input and output, which often won't include echo cancellation. To prevent the model from interrupting itself, use headphones.

Live API capabilities guide



Preview: The Live API is in preview.
This is a comprehensive guide that covers capabilities and configurations available with the Live API. See Get started with Live API page for a overview and sample code for common use cases.

Before you begin
Familiarize yourself with core concepts: If you haven't already done so, read the Get started with Live API page first. This will introduce you to the fundamental principles of the Live API, how it works, and the different implementation approaches.
Try the Live API in AI Studio: You may find it useful to try the Live API in Google AI Studio before you start building. To use the Live API in Google AI Studio, select Stream.
Establishing a connection
The following example shows how to create a connection with an API key:

Python
JavaScript
import asyncio
from google import genai

client = genai.Client()

model = "gemini-2.5-flash-native-audio-preview-12-2025"
config = {"response_modalities": ["AUDIO"]}

async def main():
    async with client.aio.live.connect(model=model, config=config) as session:
        print("Session started")
        # Send content...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
Interaction modalities
The following sections provide examples and supporting context for the different input and output modalities available in Live API.

Sending and receiving audio
The most common audio example, audio-to-audio, is covered in the Getting started guide.

Audio formats
Audio data in the Live API is always raw, little-endian, 16-bit PCM. Audio output always uses a sample rate of 24kHz. Input audio is natively 16kHz, but the Live API will resample if needed so any sample rate can be sent. To convey the sample rate of input audio, set the MIME type of each audio-containing Blob to a value like audio/pcm;rate=16000.

Sending text
Here's how you can send text:

Python
JavaScript
message = "Hello, how are you?"
await session.send_client_content(turns=message, turn_complete=True)
Incremental content updates
Use incremental updates to send text input, establish session context, or restore session context. For short contexts you can send turn-by-turn interactions to represent the exact sequence of events:

Python
JavaScript
turns = [
    {"role": "user", "parts": [{"text": "What is the capital of France?"}]},
    {"role": "model", "parts": [{"text": "Paris"}]},
]

await session.send_client_content(turns=turns, turn_complete=False)

turns = [{"role": "user", "parts": [{"text": "What is the capital of Germany?"}]}]

await session.send_client_content(turns=turns, turn_complete=True)
For longer contexts it's recommended to provide a single message summary to free up the context window for subsequent interactions. See Session Resumption for another method for loading session context.

Audio transcriptions
In addition to the model response, you can also receive transcriptions of both the audio output and the audio input.

To enable transcription of the model's audio output, send output_audio_transcription in the setup config. The transcription language is inferred from the model's response.

Python
JavaScript
import asyncio
from google import genai
from google.genai import types

client = genai.Client()
model = "gemini-2.5-flash-native-audio-preview-12-2025"

config = {
    "response_modalities": ["AUDIO"],
    "output_audio_transcription": {}
}

async def main():
    async with client.aio.live.connect(model=model, config=config) as session:
        message = "Hello? Gemini are you there?"

        await session.send_client_content(
            turns={"role": "user", "parts": [{"text": message}]}, turn_complete=True
        )

        async for response in session.receive():
            if response.server_content.model_turn:
                print("Model turn:", response.server_content.model_turn)
            if response.server_content.output_transcription:
                print("Transcript:", response.server_content.output_transcription.text)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
To enable transcription of the model's audio input, send input_audio_transcription in setup config.

Python
JavaScript
import asyncio
from pathlib import Path
from google import genai
from google.genai import types

client = genai.Client()
model = "gemini-2.5-flash-native-audio-preview-12-2025"

config = {
    "response_modalities": ["AUDIO"],
    "input_audio_transcription": {},
}

async def main():
    async with client.aio.live.connect(model=model, config=config) as session:
        audio_data = Path("16000.pcm").read_bytes()

        await session.send_realtime_input(
            audio=types.Blob(data=audio_data, mime_type='audio/pcm;rate=16000')
        )

        async for msg in session.receive():
            if msg.server_content.input_transcription:
                print('Transcript:', msg.server_content.input_transcription.text)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
Stream audio and video
To see an example of how to use the Live API in a streaming audio and video format, run the "Live API - Get Started" file in the cookbooks repository:

View on Colab

Change voice and language
Native audio output models support any of the voices available for our Text-to-Speech (TTS) models. You can listen to all the voices in AI Studio.

To specify a voice, set the voice name within the speechConfig object as part of the session configuration:

Python
JavaScript
config = {
    "response_modalities": ["AUDIO"],
    "speech_config": {
        "voice_config": {"prebuilt_voice_config": {"voice_name": "Kore"}}
    },
}
Note: If you're using the generateContent API, the set of available voices is slightly different. See the audio generation guide for generateContent audio generation voices.
The Live API supports multiple languages. Native audio output models automatically choose the appropriate language and don't support explicitly setting the language code.

Native audio capabilities
Our latest models feature native audio output, which provides natural, realistic-sounding speech and improved multilingual performance. Native audio also enables advanced features like affective (emotion-aware) dialogue, proactive audio (where the model intelligently decides when to respond to input), and "thinking".

Affective dialog
This feature lets Gemini adapt its response style to the input expression and tone.

To use affective dialog, set the api version to v1alpha and set enable_affective_dialog to truein the setup message:

Python
JavaScript
client = genai.Client(http_options={"api_version": "v1alpha"})

config = types.LiveConnectConfig(
    response_modalities=["AUDIO"],
    enable_affective_dialog=True
)
Proactive audio
When this feature is enabled, Gemini can proactively decide not to respond if the content is not relevant.

To use it, set the api version to v1alpha and configure the proactivity field in the setup message and set proactive_audio to true:

Python
JavaScript
client = genai.Client(http_options={"api_version": "v1alpha"})

config = types.LiveConnectConfig(
    response_modalities=["AUDIO"],
    proactivity={'proactive_audio': True}
)
Thinking
The latest native audio output model gemini-2.5-flash-native-audio-preview-12-2025 supports thinking capabilities, with dynamic thinking enabled by default.

The thinkingBudget parameter guides the model on the number of thinking tokens to use when generating a response. You can disable thinking by setting thinkingBudget to 0. For more info on the thinkingBudget configuration details of the model, see the thinking budgets documentation.

Python
JavaScript
model = "gemini-2.5-flash-native-audio-preview-12-2025"

config = types.LiveConnectConfig(
    response_modalities=["AUDIO"]
    thinking_config=types.ThinkingConfig(
        thinking_budget=1024,
    )
)

async with client.aio.live.connect(model=model, config=config) as session:
    # Send audio input and receive audio
Additionally, you can enable thought summaries by setting includeThoughts to true in your configuration. See thought summaries for more info:

Python
JavaScript
model = "gemini-2.5-flash-native-audio-preview-12-2025"

config = types.LiveConnectConfig(
    response_modalities=["AUDIO"]
    thinking_config=types.ThinkingConfig(
        thinking_budget=1024,
        include_thoughts=True
    )
)
Voice Activity Detection (VAD)
Voice Activity Detection (VAD) allows the model to recognize when a person is speaking. This is essential for creating natural conversations, as it allows a user to interrupt the model at any time.

When VAD detects an interruption, the ongoing generation is canceled and discarded. Only the information already sent to the client is retained in the session history. The server then sends a BidiGenerateContentServerContent message to report the interruption.

The Gemini server then discards any pending function calls and sends a BidiGenerateContentServerContent message with the IDs of the canceled calls.

Python
JavaScript
async for response in session.receive():
    if response.server_content.interrupted is True:
        # The generation was interrupted

        # If realtime playback is implemented in your application,
        # you should stop playing audio and clear queued playback here.
Automatic VAD
By default, the model automatically performs VAD on a continuous audio input stream. VAD can be configured with the realtimeInputConfig.automaticActivityDetection field of the setup configuration.

When the audio stream is paused for more than a second (for example, because the user switched off the microphone), an audioStreamEnd event should be sent to flush any cached audio. The client can resume sending audio data at any time.

Python
JavaScript
# example audio file to try:
# URL = "https://storage.googleapis.com/generativeai-downloads/data/hello_are_you_there.pcm"
# !wget -q $URL -O sample.pcm
import asyncio
from pathlib import Path
from google import genai
from google.genai import types

client = genai.Client()
model = "gemini-live-2.5-flash-preview"

config = {"response_modalities": ["TEXT"]}

async def main():
    async with client.aio.live.connect(model=model, config=config) as session:
        audio_bytes = Path("sample.pcm").read_bytes()

        await session.send_realtime_input(
            audio=types.Blob(data=audio_bytes, mime_type="audio/pcm;rate=16000")
        )

        # if stream gets paused, send:
        # await session.send_realtime_input(audio_stream_end=True)

        async for response in session.receive():
            if response.text is not None:
                print(response.text)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
With send_realtime_input, the API will respond to audio automatically based on VAD. While send_client_content adds messages to the model context in order, send_realtime_input is optimized for responsiveness at the expense of deterministic ordering.

Automatic VAD configuration
For more control over the VAD activity, you can configure the following parameters. See API reference for more info.

Python
JavaScript
from google.genai import types

config = {
    "response_modalities": ["TEXT"],
    "realtime_input_config": {
        "automatic_activity_detection": {
            "disabled": False, # default
            "start_of_speech_sensitivity": types.StartSensitivity.START_SENSITIVITY_LOW,
            "end_of_speech_sensitivity": types.EndSensitivity.END_SENSITIVITY_LOW,
            "prefix_padding_ms": 20,
            "silence_duration_ms": 100,
        }
    }
}
Disable automatic VAD
Alternatively, the automatic VAD can be disabled by setting realtimeInputConfig.automaticActivityDetection.disabled to true in the setup message. In this configuration the client is responsible for detecting user speech and sending activityStart and activityEnd messages at the appropriate times. An audioStreamEnd isn't sent in this configuration. Instead, any interruption of the stream is marked by an activityEnd message.

Python
JavaScript
config = {
    "response_modalities": ["TEXT"],
    "realtime_input_config": {"automatic_activity_detection": {"disabled": True}},
}

async with client.aio.live.connect(model=model, config=config) as session:
    # ...
    await session.send_realtime_input(activity_start=types.ActivityStart())
    await session.send_realtime_input(
        audio=types.Blob(data=audio_bytes, mime_type="audio/pcm;rate=16000")
    )
    await session.send_realtime_input(activity_end=types.ActivityEnd())
    # ...
Token count
You can find the total number of consumed tokens in the usageMetadata field of the returned server message.

Python
JavaScript

async for message in session.receive():
    # The server will periodically send messages that include UsageMetadata.
    if message.usage_metadata:
        usage = message.usage_metadata
        print(
            f"Used {usage.total_token_count} tokens in total. Response token breakdown:"
        )
        for detail in usage.response_tokens_details:
            match detail:
                case types.ModalityTokenCount(modality=modality, token_count=count):
                    print(f"{modality}: {count}")
Media resolution
You can specify the media resolution for the input media by setting the mediaResolution field as part of the session configuration:

Python
JavaScript

from google.genai import types

config = {
    "response_modalities": ["AUDIO"],
    "media_resolution": types.MediaResolution.MEDIA_RESOLUTION_LOW,
}
Limitations
Consider the following limitations of the Live API when you plan your project.

Response modalities
You can only set one response modality (TEXT or AUDIO) per session in the session configuration. Setting both results in a config error message. This means that you can configure the model to respond with either text or audio, but not both in the same session.

Client authentication
The Live API only provides server-to-server authentication by default. If you're implementing your Live API application using a client-to-server approach, you need to use ephemeral tokens to mitigate security risks.

Session duration
Audio-only sessions are limited to 15 minutes, and audio plus video sessions are limited to 2 minutes. However, you can configure different session management techniques for unlimited extensions on session duration.

Context window
A session has a context window limit of:

128k tokens for native audio output models
32k tokens for other Live API models
Supported languages
Live API supports the following languages.

Note: Native audio output models automatically choose the appropriate language and don't support explicitly setting the language code.
Language	BCP-47 Code	Language	BCP-47 Code
German (Germany)	de-DE	English (Australia)*	en-AU
English (UK)*	en-GB	English (India)	en-IN

Tool use with Live API



Tool use allows Live API to go beyond just conversation by enabling it to perform actions in the real-world and pull in external context while maintaining a real time connection. You can define tools such as Function calling and Google Search with the Live API.

Overview of supported tools
Here's a brief overview of the available tools for Live API models:

Tool	gemini-2.5-flash-native-audio-preview-12-2025
Search	Yes
Function calling	Yes
Google Maps	No
Code execution	No
URL context	No
Function calling
Live API supports function calling, just like regular content generation requests. Function calling lets the Live API interact with external data and programs, greatly increasing what your applications can accomplish.

You can define function declarations as part of the session configuration. After receiving tool calls, the client should respond with a list of FunctionResponse objects using the session.send_tool_response method.

See the Function calling tutorial to learn more.

Note: Unlike the generateContent API, the Live API doesn't support automatic tool response handling. You must handle tool responses manually in your client code.

From a single prompt, the model can generate multiple function calls and the code necessary to chain their outputs. This code executes in a sandbox environment, generating subsequent BidiGenerateContentToolCall messages.

Asynchronous function calling
Function calling executes sequentially by default, meaning execution pauses until the results of each function call are available. This ensures sequential processing, which means you won't be able to continue interacting with the model while the functions are being run.

If you don't want to block the conversation, you can tell the model to run the functions asynchronously. To do so, you first need to add a behavior to the function definitions:

Python
JavaScript

# Non-blocking function definitions
turn_on_the_lights = {"name": "turn_on_the_lights", "behavior": "NON_BLOCKING"} # turn_on_the_lights will run asynchronously
turn_off_the_lights = {"name": "turn_off_the_lights"} # turn_off_the_lights will still pause all interactions with the model
NON-BLOCKING ensures the function runs asynchronously while you can continue interacting with the model.

Then you need to tell the model how to behave when it receives the FunctionResponse using the scheduling parameter. It can either:

Interrupt what it's doing and tell you about the response it got right away (scheduling="INTERRUPT"),
Wait until it's finished with what it's currently doing (scheduling="WHEN_IDLE"),
Or do nothing and use that knowledge later on in the discussion (scheduling="SILENT")

Python
JavaScript

# for a non-blocking function definition, apply scheduling in the function response:
  function_response = types.FunctionResponse(
      id=fc.id,
      name=fc.name,
      response={
          "result": "ok",
          "scheduling": "INTERRUPT" # Can also be WHEN_IDLE or SILENT
      }
  )
Grounding with Google Search
You can enable Grounding with Google Search as part of the session configuration. This increases the Live API's accuracy and prevents hallucinations. See the Grounding tutorial to learn more.

Python
JavaScript

import asyncio
import wave
from google import genai
from google.genai import types

client = genai.Client()

model = "gemini-2.5-flash-native-audio-preview-12-2025"

tools = [{'google_search': {}}]
config = {"response_modalities": ["AUDIO"], "tools": tools}

async def main():
    async with client.aio.live.connect(model=model, config=config) as session:
        prompt = "When did the last Brazil vs. Argentina soccer match happen?"
        await session.send_client_content(turns={"parts": [{"text": prompt}]})

        wf = wave.open("audio.wav", "wb")
        wf.setnchannels(1)
        wf.setsampwidth(2)
        wf.setframerate(24000)  # Output is 24kHz

        async for chunk in session.receive():
            if chunk.server_content:
                if chunk.data is not None:
                    wf.writeframes(chunk.data)

                # The model might generate and execute Python code to use Search
                model_turn = chunk.server_content.model_turn
                if model_turn:
                    for part in model_turn.parts:
                        if part.executable_code is not None:
                            print(part.executable_code.code)

                        if part.code_execution_result is not None:
                            print(part.code_execution_result.output)

        wf.close()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
Combining multiple tools
You can combine multiple tools within the Live API, increasing your application's capabilities even more:

Python
JavaScript

prompt = """
Hey, I need you to do two things for me.

1. Use Google Search to look up information about the largest earthquake in California the week of Dec 5 2024?
2. Then turn on the lights

Thanks!
"""

tools = [
    {"google_search": {}},
    {"function_declarations": [turn_on_the_lights, turn_off_the_lights]},
]

config = {"response_modalities": ["AUDIO"], "tools": tools}

# ... remaining model call

Session management with Live API



In the Live API, a session refers to a persistent connection where input and output are streamed continuously over the same connection (read more about how it works). This unique session design enables low latency and supports unique features, but can also introduce challenges, like session time limits, and early termination. This guide covers strategies for overcoming the session management challenges that can arise when using the Live API.

Session lifetime
Without compression, audio-only sessions are limited to 15 minutes, and audio-video sessions are limited to 2 minutes. Exceeding these limits will terminate the session (and therefore, the connection), but you can use context window compression to extend sessions to an unlimited amount of time.

The lifetime of a connection is limited as well, to around 10 minutes. When the connection terminates, the session terminates as well. In this case, you can configure a single session to stay active over multiple connections using session resumption. You'll also receive a GoAway message before the connection ends, allowing you to take further actions.

Context window compression
To enable longer sessions, and avoid abrupt connection termination, you can enable context window compression by setting the contextWindowCompression field as part of the session configuration.

In the ContextWindowCompressionConfig, you can configure a sliding-window mechanism and the number of tokens that triggers compression.

Python
JavaScript

from google.genai import types

config = types.LiveConnectConfig(
    response_modalities=["AUDIO"],
    context_window_compression=(
        # Configures compression with default parameters.
        types.ContextWindowCompressionConfig(
            sliding_window=types.SlidingWindow(),
        )
    ),
)
Session resumption
To prevent session termination when the server periodically resets the WebSocket connection, configure the sessionResumption field within the setup configuration.

Passing this configuration causes the server to send SessionResumptionUpdate messages, which can be used to resume the session by passing the last resumption token as the SessionResumptionConfig.handle of the subsequent connection.

Resumption tokens are valid for 2 hr after the last sessions termination.

Python
JavaScript

import asyncio
from google import genai
from google.genai import types

client = genai.Client()
model = "gemini-2.5-flash-native-audio-preview-12-2025"

async def main():
    print(f"Connecting to the service with handle {previous_session_handle}...")
    async with client.aio.live.connect(
        model=model,
        config=types.LiveConnectConfig(
            response_modalities=["AUDIO"],
            session_resumption=types.SessionResumptionConfig(
                # The handle of the session to resume is passed here,
                # or else None to start a new session.
                handle=previous_session_handle
            ),
        ),
    ) as session:
        while True:
            await session.send_client_content(
                turns=types.Content(
                    role="user", parts=[types.Part(text="Hello world!")]
                )
            )
            async for message in session.receive():
                # Periodically, the server will send update messages that may
                # contain a handle for the current state of the session.
                if message.session_resumption_update:
                    update = message.session_resumption_update
                    if update.resumable and update.new_handle:
                        # The handle should be retained and linked to the session.
                        return update.new_handle

                # For the purposes of this example, placeholder input is continually fed
                # to the model. In non-sample code, the model inputs would come from
                # the user.
                if message.server_content and message.server_content.turn_complete:
                    break

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
Receiving a message before the session disconnects
The server sends a GoAway message that signals that the current connection will soon be terminated. This message includes the timeLeft, indicating the remaining time and lets you take further action before the connection will be terminated as ABORTED.

Python
JavaScript

async for response in session.receive():
    if response.go_away is not None:
        # The connection will soon be terminated
        print(response.go_away.time_left)
Receiving a message when the generation is complete
The server sends a generationComplete message that signals that the model finished generating the response.

Python
JavaScript

async for response in session.receive():
    if response.server_content.generation_complete is True:
        # The generation is complete

Ephemeral tokens



Ephemeral tokens are short-lived authentication tokens for accessing the Gemini API through WebSockets. They are designed to enhance security when you are connecting directly from a user's device to the API (a client-to-server implementation). Like standard API keys, ephemeral tokens can be extracted from client-side applications such as web browsers or mobile apps. But because ephemeral tokens expire quickly and can be restricted, they significantly reduce the security risks in a production environment. You should use them when accessing the Live API directly from client-side applications to enhance API key security.

Note: At this time, ephemeral tokens are only compatible with Live API.
How ephemeral tokens work
Here's how ephemeral tokens work at a high level:

Your client (e.g. web app) authenticates with your backend.
Your backend requests an ephemeral token from Gemini API's provisioning service.
Gemini API issues a short-lived token.
Your backend sends the token to the client for WebSocket connections to Live API. You can do this by swapping your API key with an ephemeral token.
The client then uses the token as if it were an API key.
Ephemeral tokens overview

This enhances security because even if extracted, the token is short-lived, unlike a long-lived API key deployed client-side. Since the client sends data directly to Gemini, this also improves latency and avoids your backends needing to proxy the real time data.

Create an ephemeral token
Here is a simplified example of how to get an ephemeral token from Gemini. By default, you'll have 1 minute to start new Live API sessions using the token from this request (newSessionExpireTime), and 30 minutes to send messages over that connection (expireTime).

Python
JavaScript

import datetime

now = datetime.datetime.now(tz=datetime.timezone.utc)

client = genai.Client(
    http_options={'api_version': 'v1alpha',}
)

token = client.auth_tokens.create(
    config = {
    'uses': 1, # The ephemeral token can only be used to start a single session
    'expire_time': now + datetime.timedelta(minutes=30), # Default is 30 minutes in the future
    # 'expire_time': '2025-05-17T00:00:00Z',   # Accepts isoformat.
    'new_session_expire_time': now + datetime.timedelta(minutes=1), # Default 1 minute in the future
    'http_options': {'api_version': 'v1alpha'},
  }
)

# You'll need to pass the value under token.name back to your client to use it
For expireTime value constraints, defaults, and other field specs, see the API reference. Within the expireTime timeframe, you'll need sessionResumption to reconnect the call every 10 minutes (this can be done with the same token even if uses: 1).

It's also possible to lock an ephemeral token to a set of configurations. This might be useful to further improve security of your application and keep your system instructions on the server side.

Python
JavaScript

client = genai.Client(
    http_options={'api_version': 'v1alpha',}
)

token = client.auth_tokens.create(
    config = {
    'uses': 1,
    'live_connect_constraints': {
        'model': 'gemini-2.5-flash-native-audio-preview-12-2025',
        'config': {
            'session_resumption':{},
            'temperature':0.7,
            'response_modalities':['AUDIO']
        }
    },
    'http_options': {'api_version': 'v1alpha'},
    }
)

# You'll need to pass the value under token.name back to your client to use it
You can also lock a subset of fields, see the SDK documentation for more info.

Connect to Live API with an ephemeral token
Once you have an ephemeral token, you use it as if it were an API key (but remember, it only works for the live API, and only with the v1alpha version of the API).

The use of ephemeral tokens only adds value when deploying applications that follow client-to-server implementation approach.

JavaScript

import { GoogleGenAI, Modality } from '@google/genai';

// Use the token generated in the "Create an ephemeral token" section here
const ai = new GoogleGenAI({
  apiKey: token.name
});
const model = 'gemini-2.5-flash-native-audio-preview-12-2025';
const config = { responseModalities: [Modality.AUDIO] };

async function main() {

  const session = await ai.live.connect({
    model: model,
    config: config,
    callbacks: { ... },
  });

  // Send content...

  session.close();
}

main();
Note: If not using the SDK, note that ephemeral tokens must either be passed in an access_token query parameter, or in an HTTP Authorization prefixed by the auth-scheme Token.
See Get started with Live API for more examples.

Best practices
Set a short expiration duration using the expire_time parameter.
Tokens expire, requiring re-initiation of the provisioning process.
Verify secure authentication for your own backend. Ephemeral tokens will only be as secure as your backend authentication method.
Generally, avoid using ephemeral tokens for backend-to-Gemini connections, as this path is typically considered secure.
Limitations
Ephemeral tokens are only compatible with Live API at this time.

What's next
Read the Live API reference on ephemeral tokens for more information.
